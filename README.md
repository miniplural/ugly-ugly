github procedure:
1. before you start changing things, fetch from the origin to ensure you're up to date
2. when committing changes, always commit them to a test branch-- never to the master (i will do that)
3. commit changes with a summary of what you changed and on what date you changed them
4. after committing and pushing to origin, send me a message so i can merge them with the rest of the repo!

if you have any issues with github, we can ask someone from the GDDC
